2022 Computer Vision Code for FRC 2601 Game

While we ended up working with Limelight for 2022 FRC season, our development project working with computer vision utilizing OpenCV and other related Python libraries
were a significant enough undertaking that it constituted a good portion of our development work for the year.  

This project primarily utilizes OpenCV to detect the position of relevant game pieces on a FRC 2022 React field, utilizing color masks and shape detection to narrow down
potential targets.  The control system component of our robot would then take the live position data of the pieces and navigate accordingly.
